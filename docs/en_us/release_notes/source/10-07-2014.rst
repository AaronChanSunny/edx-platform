****************************************
edX Release Announcements Mailing List
****************************************

These edX Course Staff Release Notes are always available and are updated with
each release of the edX Platform on `edx.org`_ and `edX Edge`_.

You can also sign up for the `edX Release Announcements mailing list`_ to get
an email message when we update the edX Course Staff Release Notes.


*******************************
edX Learning Management System
*******************************

* The cohorts feature has been released! This feature allows course
  teams and TAs to assign students to different cohorts in class discussions.
  Students in different cohorts can see the discussions for their
  individual cohorts, but cannot see discussions for other cohorts. Course
  teams can also open some course discussions to all students.

* On the Instructor Dashboard, the **Download profile information as a CSV**
  button has been moved to the **Reports** page. Additionally, the CSV file that
  users download to find student profile data now contains a **Cohort** column.
  (TNL-453)

* All course authors can now see a link to edX Insights on the Instructor Dashboard.

* Course discussions have several new features:

  * Students and course authors can now change the topic of a post after they post it.

  * Users no longer have the option to add comments to closed threads. (TNL-150)

  * When a user selects a topic and subtopic for a post, a link to the unit for
    that topic and subtopic in the courseware now appears immediately when the
    post is created. (TNL-404)

  * Users who have been added as discussion administrators can now remove their
    own or other users' discussion administrator status. (TNL-315)

  * For some users, discussion threads did not appear in the left sidebar when
    the user clicked **Posts I'm Following**. This bug has been fixed. (TNL-469)

  * Pinned threads now always appear at the top of the list of posts, regardless
    of the way that the posts are sorted. (TNL-90)

* In some browsers, if a student clicked a word in a transcript to move to that
  point in the video, the video began playing from the correct point, but the
  transcript stopped following along with the video. This bug has been fixed.
  (TNL-235)

*************
edX Studio

* In HTML text components, the default font now appears as an option in the
  **Font** menu. (TNL-147)

* When a Problem component contained a custom JavaScript display and grading (JS
  Input) problem and at least one other problem, the JS Input problem was scored
  incorrectly. The additional problem in the component could be any type of
  problem. These problems are now scored correctly. (TNL-269)

* When you exported a course, the setting for **Video Download Allowed** in a
  Video component changed from **False** to **True** in the exported course.
  This bug has been fixed. (TNL-324)
