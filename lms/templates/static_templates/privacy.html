<h2>What Information We Collect</h2>
<p>We have implemented this Privacy Policy because your privacy, and the privacy of other Service users, is important to us.  This Privacy Policy applies to websites operated in the United States and the European Union (“EU”) and we provide this Privacy Policy explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way Personal Information is collected and used in connection with the Service.  “Personal Information” means any information that may be used, either alone or in combination with other information, to personally identify an individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, a personal profile, an email address or other contact information.</p>
<p>We operate in accordance with applicable data protection legislation.  We recognize the importance of protecting the privacy of individual-specific information (&#8220;Personal Information&#8221;) collected about our users (referred to as “users,” &#8220;you&#8221; or &#8220;your&#8221;). This privacy policy discloses what Personal Information we gather, how we use it, and how you can correct or change it.  It is our intention to give you as much control over your Personal Information as possible to preserve your privacy, while still allowing us to utilize that Personal Information in the course of our business to provide you a valuable service.</p>
<p><u>Consent and Modification</u>.  By using the Service, you consent to the terms of this Privacy Policy and to our processing of Personal Information for the purposes set forth herein.  If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Service.  We reserve the right, at our discretion, to change this Privacy Policy at any time, which change will be effective ten (10) days following posting the revised Privacy Policy on the Site.  Your continued use of the Service ten (10) days following such posting means you accept those changes.</p>
<p><u>Receipt and Collection of Information</u>.  We occasionally collect Personal Information from users.  In each case, you will only be required to provide the Personal Information that we need in order to be able to provide the services you have requested.  You may be entitled under data protection laws to access and review the Personal Information that we hold on you, if you provide the necessary consent and background information and pay any mandated fee.  All such communications regarding access to your personal data should be addressed to: security@appsembler.com. Such enquiries should clearly be marked as data protection queries and as being time sensitive.</p>
<p>In particular, we receive and/or collect Personal Information from you in the following ways:  This Privacy Policy applies to all information collected by or submitted to NodeRabbit (or carefully selected third parties acting on NodeRabbit’s behalf), including Personal Information.  “Personal Information” is data that reasonably can be used to identify or describe an individual.

</ul>
<p><strong>Use of Your Personal Information:</strong> NodeRabbit collects and uses your Personal Information to operate and improve its sites and deliver the Service or carry out the transactions you have requested. These uses may include providing you with more effective customer service; making the sites or services easier to use by eliminating the need for you to repeatedly enter the same information; performing research and analysis aimed at improving our products, services and technologies; and displaying content and advertising that are customized to your interests and preferences.</p>
<p>We also use your Personal Information to communicate with you. We may send certain mandatory service communications such as welcome letters, billing reminders, information on technical service issues, and security announcements. Some NodeRabbit services may send periodic member letters that are considered part of the Service. We may also contact you to inform you of other products or services available from NodeRabbit and its affiliates.</p>
<p>Personal Information collected on NodeRabbit Sites and services may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which NodeRabbit or its affiliates, subsidiaries or agents maintain facilities, and by using a NodeRabbit Site or Service, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country.  We may transfer your Personal Information to our affiliated companies for the purpose of storing or processing such information on our behalf.  Such information may be transferred to other countries around the world.  We require that these parties agree to process such information in compliance with our Privacy Policy.  In particular, if you provide Personal Information to us it may be transferred to and processed on computers in the U.S. and other countries.  Do not provide your Personal Information to us through this website if you do not want this information to be transferred outside of your country, or if the laws in your country restrict these types of transfers.  Your provision of Personal Information to us will be handled in accordance with this Privacy Policy.  From time to time, your Personal Information may be transferred to a country different from where you are located.  Your legal rights may be different in these countries, but we will hold your Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.  You hereby consent to such transfers and processing as described in this Privacy Policy, except in the case of data transfers from the European Economic Area or Switzerland, which our covered under the EU Safe Harbor Framework.  Your provision of Personal Information to us through this website means that you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>We may transfer your Personal Information to our third party service providers (such as a server hosting provider), but only to provide our services to you.  Such information may be transferred to other countries around the world.  We use commercially reasonable efforts to only engage or interact with third party service providers that post a privacy policy governing their processing of Personal Information.</p>
<p>We may disclose your Personal Information or any information you submitted via the Service if we have a good faith belief that disclosure of such information is helpful or reasonably necessary to: (i) comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request; (ii) enforce any applicable terms of service, including investigations of potential violations thereof; (iii) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud or security issues; or (iv) protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of NodeRabbit, our users, yourself or the public.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing of Your Personal Information:</strong> NodeRabbit will not sell, rent or lease your Personal Information to others. NodeRabbit shares Personal Information with companies working on our behalf and NodeRabbit-owned business entities. Except as described in this statement, we will not disclose your Personal Information to third parties for their own marketing purposes unless you have provided consent.</p>
<p>Some NodeRabbit services may be co-branded and offered in conjunction with another company. If you register for or use such services, both NodeRabbit and the other company may receive information collected as part of the co-branded services.</p>
<p>In some cases NodeRabbit uses contractors to collect, use, analyze and otherwise process information on its behalf. It is NodeRabbit’s practice to require such suppliers to handle information in a manner consistent with NodeRabbit’s policies. NodeRabbit may also allow carefully selected NodeRabbit partners to participate in limited marketing campaigns solely to promote NodeRabbit’s products and services to you.</p>
<p>If you request something from a NodeRabbit Site (for example, a product or service, a callback, or specific marketing materials), we will use the information you provide to fulfill your request. To help us do this, we may share information with others, such as NodeRabbit’s business partners, financial institutions, shipping companies, and postal or government authorities (e.g., Customs authorities) involved in fulfillment. As part of a transaction, we may also contact you as part of our customer satisfaction surveys or for market research purposes.</p>
<p>We occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, such as handling the processing and delivery of mailings, providing customer support, hosting websites, processing transactions, or performing statistical analysis of our services. Those companies will be permitted to obtain only the Personal Information they need to deliver the service. They are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information and are prohibited from using it for any other purpose.</p>
<p>We may access and/or disclose your Personal Information if we believe such action is necessary to: (a) comply with the law or legal process served on NodeRabbit; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of NodeRabbit (including the enforcement of our agreements); or (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of NodeRabbit services or members of the public.</p>
<p><strong>Your Choices:</strong> NodeRabbit provides a number of ways for you to ‘opt-out’ of receiving additional information from us or having us provide your Personal Information to our partners. We may offer you these choices at the time you give us your information.</p>
<p>If you do not wish to continue receiving certain marketing materials (e.g., e-mail messages), you can opt-out of receiving these materials by following the unsubscribe instructions provided in the materials. This option does not apply to communications primarily for the purpose of administering orders, contracts, support, product safety warnings, software updates, or other administrative and transactional notices.</p>
<p><u>Use of Anonymous Information</u>.  We may use Anonymous Information (as defined below), or disclose it to third party service providers, to provide and improve the Service.  We may also disclose Anonymous Information (with or without compensation) to third parties, including advertisers and partners, for purposes including, but not limited to, targeting advertisements.  &#8220;Anonymous Information&#8221; means information which does not enable identification of an individual user, such as aggregated information about use of the Service.</p>
<p><u>Opting Out</u>.  You may choose not to receive future promotional, advertising, or other Service-related notifications from us by changing the notification settings on your device.  If you choose not to receive notifications, you may still use the Service but you may not receive, or may be unable to use, certain services that involve our interaction with you.</p>
<p><u>Choice</u>.  At all times, you may choose whether or not to provide or disclose Personal Information.  The notices that we provide on the Service in circumstances where we collect Personal Information should help you to make this choice. If you choose not to provide the Personal Information we request, you may still use the Service, but you may be unable to access certain programs and services that involve our interaction with you.</p>
<p><u>Access/Accuracy</u>.  To the extent that you do provide us with Personal Information, we wish to maintain accurate Personal Information.  If you would like to delete or correct any other of your Personal Information that we may be storing, you may submit a request to us by sending an email to <a href="mailto:info@appsembler.com">info@appsembler.com</a>.  Your email should include adequate details of your request.</p>
<p><u>Collection of Information by Third-Party Sites</u>.  We may use a reputable third party to present or serve advertisements that you may see on the Service.  These third party ad servers may use cookies, web beacons, clear gifs or similar technologies to help present such advertisements, and to help measure and research the advertisements&#8217; effectiveness. The use of these technologies by these third party ad servers is subject to their own privacy policies and is not covered by our Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><u>Links to Other Sites</u>.  The Service may contain links to third party websites that are not owned or controlled by us.  We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such other third party websites, and you visit them at your own risk.</p>
<p><u>Service Visitors from outside the United States</u>.  We and our servers are located in the United States and Europe and are subject to the applicable local and national laws.  Those who choose to access the Service do so on their own initiative and at their own risk, and are responsible for complying with all local laws, rules and regulations. We may limit the Service’s availability, in whole or in part, to any person, geographic area or jurisdiction we choose, at any time and in our sole discretion. We do not represent or warrant that the Service, or any part thereof, is appropriate or available for use in any other jurisdiction. If users choose to access or use the Service, they consent to the use and disclosure of information in accordance with this privacy policy and subject to such laws.</p>
<p><u>Children&#8217;s Privacy</u>.  The Service is neither directed to nor structured to attract children under the age of 13 years.  Accordingly, we do not intend to collect Personal Information from anyone we know to be under 13 years of age.  We will direct potential users under 13 years of age not to use the Service. If we learn that Personal Information of persons less than 13 years of age has been collected without verifiable parental consent, then we will take the appropriate steps to delete this information. To make such a request, or if there are any questions or concerns about the Privacy Policy for the Service or its implementation, please contact us at privacy@appsembler.com.</p>
<p><u>Security</u>.  The security of your Personal Information is important to us.  We follow generally accepted industry standards, including the use of appropriate administrative, physical and technical safeguards, to protect the Personal Information submitted to us.  However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security or confidentiality. If you have any questions about security, you can contact us at <a href="mailto:security@appsembler.com">security@appsembler.com</a>.</p>
<p>Please be aware that certain Personal Information and other information provided by you in connection with your use of the App may be stored on your device (even if we do not collect that information).  You are solely responsible for maintaining the security of your device from unauthorized access.</p>
<p><u>Merger, Sale or Bankruptcy</u>.  If we are acquired by or merged with a third party entity, or if we are subject to a bankruptcy or any comparable event, we reserve the right to transfer or assign Personal Information in connection therewith.</p>
<p><u>California Online Privacy Protection Act Notice</u></p>
<p>On September 27, 2013, California enacted A.B. 370, amending the California Online Privacy Protection Act to require website operators like us to disclose how we respond to &#8220;Do Not Track Signals&#8221;; and whether third parties collect personally identifiable information about users when they visit us.</p>
